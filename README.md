# CarClock

## Overview
My 2017 Toyota Camry is a great car, however, for the last few years, it gets into a situation where the entertainment system (or whatever you call it) won't fully initialize -- it just sits at the splash screen for a while, then reboots and goes back to the splash screen, then reboots, and so on...  From what I've read, this is likely due to a bad connector between the head unit and the external Bluetooth unit.  This situation happens a few times a year, and I can live with it, but alas, the one and only clock in the car is shown on the entertainment system.  Thus, because the system won't complete initialization, it never gets to the main screen where the clock is displayed, and I'm left without a clock.

So, I decided to create a real clock that I could use in my car.  The first clock I made was based off of the ESP8266 (and used the [Wemos D1 Mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html) form factor).  It's working fine for now, but eventually I will move to the ESP32 so I can add more features, but for now the ESP8266 based version is good enough.

> I'll fill this section in when I migrate the project from an ESP8266 to an ESP32.
